When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  when I have to share the code with another programer

 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 	i may be doing an experimental code and i don't want anyone to see the code until
 	is ready.

 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
 instead of another?

 	Fork is used when i want to have a copy of the repository on github to my own github,
 	clone it's used when a want to have a copy of the repository either to my local 
 	repository or from github to my local repository, and branches are used when i want 
 	to do experimental change to the code i'm working on.
