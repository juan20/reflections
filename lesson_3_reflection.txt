When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  when I have to share the code with another programer

 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 	i may be doing an experimental code and i don't want anyone to see the code until
 	is ready.

 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
 instead of another?

 	Fork is used when i want to have a copy of the repository on github to my own github,
 	clone it's used when a want to have a copy of the repository either to my local 
 	repository or from github to my local repository, and branches are used when i want 
 	to do experimental change to the code i'm working on.

 What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

 	that you can get the last update of the code and if you want to combine your code to the 
 	code it's locally, you are able to do it by using merge.

 How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would 
 be harder?

	copying the code he has and see everything he did, so i can see what i can do better or
	correct then. it'll be harder to see the difference between the code and maybe easier to
	obtain the code.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?

	every time i have to do a pull request, to colaborate with others, it give you the
	benefits to control the follow of yhe code.
